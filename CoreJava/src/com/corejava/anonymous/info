*Anonymous classes enable you to make your code more concise. 
They enable you to declare and instantiate a class at the same time. 
They are like local classes except that they do not have a name. Use them if you need 
to use a local class only once.

*The syntax of an anonymous class expression is like the invocation of a 
constructor, except that there is a class definition contained in a block of code.

*The anonymous class expression consists of the following:
The new operator
The name of an interface to implement or a class to extend. In this example, the anonymous class 
is implementing the interface HelloWorld.
Parentheses that contain the arguments to a constructor, just like a normal class 
instance creation expression. Note: When you implement an interface, 
there is no constructor, so you use an empty pair of parentheses, as in this example.
A body, which is a class declaration body. More specifically, in the body, method declarations 
are allowed but statements are not.

Because an anonymous class definition is an expression, it must be part of a statement
