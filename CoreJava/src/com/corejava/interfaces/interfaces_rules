*one can create interface inside a class
*one can never create an instance of an interface
i.e Interface will always be at LHS not at RHS of =

1]Interface without any method==marker interface

2]Interface extending other interfaces
2.1]Interface can always extend an interface
2.2]Interface can extend multiple interfaces
Example_10

3]Class implementing an interface 
Example_11

4]If you add any field to an interface 
it is static final by default
Example_10

5]Interface extending abstract/concrete classes:Example_12
An interface can only extend another interface.
