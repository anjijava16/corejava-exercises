1]A set is a collection of items that cannot contain duplicates; adding an item if it is already
present in the set has no effect. The Set interface has the same methods as those of
Collection, but it is defined separately in order to allow the contract of add (and
addAll, which is defined in terms of add) to be changed in this way.

2]There are six concrete implementations of Set in the Collections Framework.

HashSet O(1) O(1) O(h/n) h is the table capacity
LinkedHashSet O(1) O(1) O(1)
CopyOnWriteArraySet O(n) O(n) O(1)
EnumSet O(1) O(1) O(1)
TreeSet O(log n) O(log n) O(log n)
ConcurrentSkipListSet O(log n) O(log n) O(1
