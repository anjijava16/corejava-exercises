1]An abstract class must have keyword 
abstract in its declaration. 
Below is a minimalist abstract class.

public abstract class Animal {
	
}

2]If a method without body is written in abstract class
then it should have a keyword abstract in its signature.


public abstract class Animal_2 {
	public void methodWithoutBody();
	//Above code gives an error
    //"This method requires a body instead of a semicolon"
}

The correct one is below:

public abstract class Animal_2 {
	
	public abstract void methodWithoutBody();

}

3]If a method with body is written in abstract class
,then it should not have abstract keyword.
public abstract class Animal_3 {

	public void method_withBody(){
		System.out.println("Hey! look at my body");
	}
}

4]Extending Abstract class method with body:
A child class may or may not override 
a method with a body in abstract class
Example_4.java


5]Extending Abstract class having method without body i.e abstract method:
In this case child class has to provide implementation for parent class's
abstract method.Otherwise compiler will show error
Example_5.java



6]Multilevel inheritance in abstract classes
A>>B>>C :C is concrete class
6.1]How abstract method will behave
Example_7.java
6.2]How non abstract method will behave
Refer Example_6.java



7]abstract class implements interface:
A class abstract or concrete can always implement an interface it can never extend it.
Example_8.java
"Interface is always implemented"


8]abstract class implements multiple interfaces:same as 7
