When object creation is expensive in system,cloning is used.
*No constructor is called when clone method is called.

Two ways to create cloning
1]Shallow Cloning==>Field to Field copy =>
*Works for all primitive class members.
*Class need to implement Cloneable interface.
*class need to override clone method.
*instance member variable references in object are copied as it is to cloned object
(HashCode of address in original and cloned object are same)


2]Deep Cloning:
*both primitive and nonprimitive class members are cloned.
(HashCode of address in original and cloned object are different)
